BPB parser - is a proggram,that recieve a disk name from the standart output stream,using the disk name BPB parser will reading a first sector from him, after that checks,what a struct storaging  in a first sector. if  it  BPB - continue job, in other cases the proggram display error message. if a disk contains BPB struct, the proggram calculates a disk size in mega bytes, using fields,poviders the BPB struct. the proggram doesn't useful for common using,because i've written the proggram running only practice interests. You can read src code the proggram,if you want or have many  free time. i'll don't speak a history of the proggram,just think  that fact,  the proggram  have been written in practise interests
